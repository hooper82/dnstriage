# dnstriage

A small inference service that classifies DNS domains as GOOD, WARN, BAD or UNKNOWN, using curated lists first and falling back to an LLM for unknown domains.

> **Status: work in progress.**
> A sample run will appear here as features land.

## Quick start

Needs Python 3.12+ (or just Docker). The service listens on http://localhost:8080.

**Linux / macOS**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 tests/fake_model.py &       # stand-in model on port 8001 (or run it in a second terminal)
.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn app.main:app --port 8080
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt
Start-Process py tests/fake_model.py   # stand-in model on port 8001, in its own window
.venv\Scripts\python -m uvicorn app.main:app --port 8080
```

**Docker**

```bash
docker compose up --build    # starts the service and the fake model
```

Unknown domains are classified by a model. Until you point it at a real one, a **fake model**
(`tests/fake_model.py`) answers with random verdicts, so everything runs with no configuration.

**Check it works.** In a second terminal, run the smoke test (standard library only, so any Python 3 will do):

```bash
python tests/smoke.py
```

## API

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/health` | Liveness. |
| `POST` | `/ingest` | Classify a batch (JSON array, up to 10,000) of DNS query records; returns one verdict per registrable domain. |

A record looks like this:

```json
{ "ts": "2026-10-07T06:00:00Z", "client": "10.0.0.12", "domain": "example.com", "qtype": "A", "rcode": "NOERROR" }
```

Interactive docs are at http://localhost:8080/docs.

## Configuration

All settings are optional environment variables; the defaults run the demo as-is.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `BLOCKLIST_PATH` | `data/blocklist.txt` | Known-bad domains (`BAD`). One per line or hosts-file format, e.g. the abuse.ch URLhaus hostfile. |
| `ALLOWLIST_PATH` | `data/allowlist.txt` | Known-good registrable domains (`GOOD`), e.g. the Tranco top 100k. |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8001/v1` | OpenAI-compatible model endpoint. The default is the fake model. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `not-needed` | Key for the endpoint, if it needs one. |
| `MODEL_NAME` | `random` | Model to use (the fake model ignores it). |

The bundled lists are tiny samples with fake or reserved names. Lists are read at startup.

## Scope

This is a proof of concept. DNS logs are pushed to this service, while reports are pulled.

## Outside of Scope
* Event Collection - DNS logs need to be transformed and pushed to this service. Log collection, encrypted DNS (DoH/DoT) or VPNs are all outside of this service and would need to be dealt with upstream.
* Retention - Currently uses an in-memory data store, so state is lost on restart. This would need to move to a permanent DB such as SQLite or Postgres.
* Alerting - Service doesn't have a threshold for how many bad-domains or any severity level for a query.
* Context - There are good reasons for accessing BAD domains - this service only tracks, it makes no judgement as to if a node is compromised or not.
* Live reputation - The blocklist and allowlist are static files, so they go out of date. A future version would ask a domain reputation API about each domain the local lists don't cover, keeping the local lists as overrides. Suitable APIs all need a key or sign-up, so this is left out to keep the service runnable with no configuration.
* Security - No authentication, authorisation or TLS. Any client that can reach the service can push logs and read reports. Run it on a trusted network, or put it behind a reverse proxy that handles TLS and authentication.
